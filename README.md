# Spring MVC | AngularJs App #

Application that provides RESTful api with using AngularJs for creating own To-Do list.
### Frontend Overview #
It's a web application with an AngularJs-based frontend and a Spring/Hibernate based backend. The application is responsive, as it adapts to different screen sizes that provided by using bootstrap.

Also in that application I've used gulp build system. That provides browsersync, watchify and many other helpful dependencies for fast working with project.

### Backend Overview #

The backend is based on Java 8, Spring 4, JPA 2/ Hibernate 5. 
The Spring configuration is based on Java. The main Spring modules used where Spring MVC and Spring Security. 
The backend was built using the DDD approach, which includes a domain model, services, repositories and ResourceSupport for frontend/backend data transfer.

The REST web services are based on Spring MVC, JSON and HATEOAS. The unit tests are made with spring test and the REST API functional tests where made using Spring test MVC.
